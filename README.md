# Semantic-Segmentation-of-Rooftops
Semantic segmentation of rooftops in aerial imagery using a U-Net model. Includes data preprocessing, training, and visualization of predictions. Results show high accuracy, but the outputs are blurry due to class imbalance. Future improvements suggested.

**Data Access:**
The aerial imagery data used in this project is accessed directly from an online source via Google Colab, without downloading the data locally. This approach enables efficient analysis without the need for large local storage.
The data is loaded dynamically during runtime. To manually download the data you can use this link [https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/atilol/aerialimageryforroofsegmentation].
All data processing steps occur on-the-fly within the notebook environment.
